# Unemployment Analysis with Python

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on **unemployment trends in India** using Python. The dataset provides monthly unemployment statistics for various Indian states and union territories.

## Problem Statement

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project. 

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to analyze unemployment trends using Python, uncover key contributing factors, identify patterns, and provide actionable recommendations to address unemployment challenges.

## Project Overview

This notebook includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations to understand trends and patterns
- Handling missing and duplicate values
- Region-wise unemployment insights

## Dataset

The dataset used is `unemployment_in_india.csv` which contains:
- **768 rows** and **7 columns**
- Fields such as: `Region`, `Date`, `Frequency`, `Estimated Unemployment Rate`, `Estimated Employed`, etc.
- Contains **27 duplicate rows** and **28 null values** per column

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.9.13
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Visualizations

The analysis includes:
- Time series plots of unemployment rate
- Trend plots

## Conclusions

- India's unemployment rate spiked during the COVID-19 period. It remained stable around 9â€“10% until mid-2020, then surged above 24% due to lockdowns. As restrictions eased, the unemployment rate gradually declined, approaching pre-pandemic levels.
- The top five states with the highest unemployment rates are Tripura, Haryana, Jharkhand, Bihar, and Himachal Pradesh.
- The top five states with the lowest unemployment rates are Meghalaya, Odisha, Assam, Uttarakhand, and Gujarat.
- Around mid-2020, urban and rural unemployment rates experienced a sharp increase due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. Urban unemployment rate spiked above 25%, while rural unemployment rate also rose significantly, though it did not reach the same level as the urban rate.
